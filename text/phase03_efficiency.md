[](#fig:carnot_efficiency_300K) and Equation [](#eq:eff_carnot) showed that the efficiency of a Carnot engine increases with increasing $T_\text{H}$ for a given $T_\text{C}$.

One key issue is parasitic load—the energy required to run pumps that circulate water and steam. Many plants have parasitic loads of 20–30%, reducing their overall efficiency.

Another factor is super-hot-rock geothermal. At extreme temperatures, water becomes supercritical, a state that enhances power generation efficiency. Supercritical water allows for:

Maximum efficiency of a geothermal plant at different working temperatures.
The total efficiency is given by:

\eta_{\text{heat to electricity}} = \eta_{\text{heat to work}} \times \eta_{\text{generation}}
For super-hot-rock geothermal, higher temperatures and reduced parasitic losses nearly double plant efficiency. If parasitic loads were eliminated, efficiency would approach the Carnot limit.

In the next section, we’ll examine phase transitions—specifically how boiling water into steam is essential for running a heat engine. Understanding these transitions is key to designing efficient geothermal systems. -->
