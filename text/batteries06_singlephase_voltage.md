title: Voltage of a Single-Phase Battery Electrode

Using the expressions for the chemical potentials in the negative (equation 4.24) and positive (equation 4.22) electrodes, we substitute them into equation (4.6) for the voltage:

$$
V = \frac{1}{\mathscr{F}} (\mu_{\text{Li}} - \mu_{\text{“Li”}}) = \frac{1}{\mathscr{F}} \Bigl[ \mu^0_{\text{Li metal}} - \mu^0_{\text{“Li”}} - RT \ln \frac{X}{1-X} \Bigr] \qquad (4.25)
$$

An example voltage plot is shown in Figure 4.10. Note that because of the logarithmic term (due to configurational entropy), the voltage diverges (tends to infinity) as $X \to 0$. In practical terms, it is impossible to completely remove all Li from the positive electrode (i.e. to charge a battery to 100%) because doing so would require an infinite amount of energy.
