title: Chemical Potential of Li (in Negative Electrode)

In the negative electrode, Li is plated onto the lithium metal or dissolved into the electrolyte in the form of $\text{Li}^+$. The only contribution to the Gibbs free energy we consider is that of pure Li metal:

$$
G_{\text{Li}} = \mu^0_{\text{Li metal}}\, N \qquad (4.23)
$$

where $N$ is the number of Li atoms. When there is no Li present, $G_{\text{Li}} = 0$. There is also no configurational entropy associated with plating, since Li metal is a pure compound with no vacancies. Thus, we write the chemical potential as

$$
\mu_{\text{Li}} = \mu^0_{\text{Li metal}} \qquad (4.24)
$$
