Curvature shifts equilibrium by changing the chemical potential of atoms/molecules at an interface. The central statement is that the chemical potential depends on curvature, with a leading-order shift

$$
\mu(r) \approx \mu(\infty) + \frac{2\gamma \Omega}{r},
$$

where $\Omega$ is the molecular (or atomic) volume of the condensed phase and $\mu(\infty)$ is the flat-interface limit.

For vapor–liquid equilibrium, this curvature effect gives the Kelvin equation (size-dependent vapor pressure). For a spherical droplet of radius $r$,

$$
\ln\!\left(\frac{p(r)}{p(\infty)}\right) = \frac{2\gamma \Omega}{rRT}.
$$

This shows that smaller radii correspond to higher equilibrium vapor pressure. In other words, small particles are less stable unless stabilized by other effects.

- The temperature/pressure dependence of phase coexistence was derived in [Clausius-Clapeyron](phase04_Clausius_Clapeyron.md). The Kelvin relation is the curvature analog: it shifts equilibrium through interfacial energy rather than through $T$ or $P$.
- The idea that equilibrium depends on $r$ is the thermodynamic input to nucleation and ripening, developed next in [Nucleation and Ripening](phase08_nucleation_ripening.md).
