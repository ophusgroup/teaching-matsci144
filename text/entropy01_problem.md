Human civilization emits millions of tons of CO₂ into Earth's atmosphere every year. 
Natural processes which reduce atmospheric CO{sub}`2` concentration include:
- Dissolution in sea water.
- Incorporation into the terrestrial biosphere, especially forests and grasslands. 
- Weathering of silicate rocks.
- Accumulation of organic material under anaerobic conditions such as in wetlands or peat bogs. 

Unfortunately, these natural processes cannot keep pace with the CO₂ released by human industrial, transportation and agricultural production. The net result has been a consistent rise in atmospheric CO₂ concentration over the past few hundred years, shown in [](#co2_atmosphere).

[](#correlation_co2_temp) demonstrates the atmospheric CO₂ is very highly correlated to the global mean temperature. Historically, CO₂ concentration has not risen above ~325 ppmv, but in May 2023 it rose to 424 ppmv ([NOAA Global Monitoring Lab](https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/trends/data.html)). This recent rise or CO₂ concentration over the past ~200 years is extremely rapid compared to the geological timescales of previous CO₂ oscillations.

The scientific consensus is that increased greenhouse gas emissions (primarily CO₂) is driving anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change (@wiki:Scientific_consensus_on_climate_change). To tackle this issue, many researchers have proposed various methods of CO₂ capture and sequestration, either directly from the atmosphere or from industrial or agricultural processes before the CO₂ is released into the atmosphere. For example, we could capture CO₂ from a flue, which is a pipe or channel that transports exhaust gases from industrial processes, such as power plants, cement production, or steel manufacturing. Comparing CO₂ capture from the atmosphere or a flue, which process is more economical? Typically the more ecomonical process is the one which requires less energy.

This captured CO₂ could then be compressed, transported, and stored underground in geological formations, or utilized in processes like enhanced oil recovery or the production of synthetic fuels and materials.
