## Learning outcomes

By the end of this course, students will be able to:

### Module 1: CO₂ and Entropy
- Apply the First and Second Laws to energy and separation problems using internal energy, enthalpy, entropy, and Gibbs free energy.
- Quantify the entropy of mixing and use it to compute the minimum reversible work required to separate CO₂-containing mixtures, explaining why real separations necessarily require more work.
- Connect reversible pathways, chemical potentials, and thermodynamic limits to evaluate feasibility and compare alternative separation strategies.

### Module 2: Fuel Cells and Chemical Equilibria
- Determine equilibrium conditions by minimizing Gibbs free energy and applying the law of mass action to derive and interpret equilibrium constants.
- Use chemical potentials and the Nernst equation to predict fuel-cell voltage as operating conditions (activities/partial pressures) change.
- Relate chemical work to electrical work, distinguishing fuel cells from heat engines and identifying what sets voltage, efficiency, and practical performance limits.

### Module 3: Geothermal Energy and Heat Engines
- Analyze ideal heat-engine cycles by constructing and interpreting P–V and T–S diagrams, including isothermal and adiabatic steps.
- Derive Carnot efficiency and use it to estimate the maximum possible conversion of heat to work between two reservoirs.
- Explain how irreversibility (e.g., friction, finite temperature gradients, non-quasistatic steps) generates entropy and reduces real engine efficiency, with application to geothermal systems.

### Module 4: Batteries and Solid Phase Transformations
- Explain open-circuit battery voltage in terms of chemical potentials of Li in the negative and positive electrodes, and relate voltage changes to state of charge and electrode materials.
- Predict qualitative voltage–composition behavior for single-phase intercalation using configurational entropy and chemical potential concepts.
- Analyze two-phase electrodes using common-tangent constructions and the lever rule to explain voltage plateaus during phase coexistence and (de)intercalation.
